# SecureCodingClass
This program goes hand in hand with a secure coding class and assists students in gaining hands-on experience with practicing the security concepts discussed.

This program is built as a server that emulates a linux command line. Students connect to the server and learn the following concepts over the course of the various modules:
- Basic Networking
- Basic Linux commands (ls, cd, echo, cat)
- Basic user management in Linux
- Password complexity requirements and why they are necessary
- Shell commands and injecting code
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities

Why not simply use Linux Virtual Machines and simple scripts?
Because Virtual Machines are prone to problems and bugs with configurations and installations. Moreover, it is impossible to track student progress when all of their work is done in a Virtual Machine. This program, with the accompanying teacher's dashboard, will maintain progress and records in real time so that teachers will know when to slow down and review and when to quickly proceed.
