# SecureCodingClass
This program goes hand in hand with a secure coding class and assists students in gaining hands-on experience with practicing the security concepts discussed.

This program is built as a server that emulates a linux command line. Students connect to the server and learn the following concepts over the course of the various modules:
- Basic Networking
- Basic Linux commands (ls, cd, echo, cat)
- Basic user management in Linux
- Password complexity requirements and why they are necessary
- Shell commands and injecting code
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities

In addition, the program runs a simple server on which the professor can watch student progress as the students progress through the different modules.
